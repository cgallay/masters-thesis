\chapter{Abstract}
Dementia is a disease that specialists still have trouble understanding. Predicting whether a patient has dementia is done by clinicians based on cognitive tests and a scan of their brain. 

We propose a method based on deep learning that automatically gives a diagnostic and a heatmap highlighting the regions of the brain that our model points to be responsible for the dementia. The explanation obtained by our model gave expected results, notably by highlighting the hippocampus of patients with dementia.  

Therefore, we provided a proof of concept that machine learning technique can give a valuable output and helps clinicians in their decision process.
