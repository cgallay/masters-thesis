\chapter{Abstract}
Dementia is a disease that specialist still have trouble understanding. Predicting whether a patient has dementia is done by clinicians based on cognitive tests and a scan of their brain. 

We propose a method based on deep learning that automatically gives a diagnostic and an heatmap highlighting the regions of the brain that our model points to be responsible for the dementia. The explanation obtained by our model gave expected results, notably by highlighting the hippocampus of patient with dementia.  

Therefore, we provided a proof of concept that machine learning technique can gives a valuable output and helps clinicians in there decision process.
