\chapter{Introduction}
In this chapter the reader is introduce to the dementia disease, the current method for its detection, the consequences and what scientific think might be the cause of the disease. 

\section{Dementia}

Dementia is not a specific disease but an overall term used to group all diseases that are characterised by a decrease in memory, thinking capabilities, language and other skills related to the thought. With between 60 and 80 percents, Alzheimer is the most common disease-causing dementia. Desperate the fact that dementia is affecting mostly old people, it is not a normal stage of life and therefore should not be seen as sever ageing.

Figure \ref{fig:alzheimerbrain} highlights the visual differences that one can use to distinguish a Alzheimer patient from a control one. Knowing which part of the brain is affected by the disease will help us evaluate our model. We expect a good model to focus his attention on those zone in order to make its prediction. In fact one would more easily trust a model that has the same attention as a human.

\section{Current Methods}
Most of the current model for detecting dementia are based on comparing some healthy brains with the one from the patient. This requires all the brain to be align, such that a pixel at a specific coordinate is mapping to the same brain region on both images. Section \ref{sec:coregistration} describe in details how to align two images.

\section{Age vs. Dementia}

It is tempting to see dementia damaged brain as an over aged one. In both case we observe lost of white matter due to neuron death. Even though scientific currently does not know exactly what causes the disease, they do observe the presence of bio-marker such as plaque and tangle \cite{alzheimer_past_present_future}.

Despite the differences, people have build simple dementia detectors by training an age predictor on healthy brain. It appears that their predictor perform badly on dementia's brain and tend to over age people with the disease. As we trained an age predictor on healthy brain, in annex \ref{chap:age_pred} we took the opportunity to try in on our data. In fact as shown in the annex, it turns out that on our data, such a predictor would perform badly. This tend to show that indeed the assumption is wrong and that dement person do not have an overage brain.

In General it would be more interesting to build a model that is able to detect dementia regardless the age of the patient, therefore being biased as little as possible with respect to age.
